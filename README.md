# Syed Zaheed

**`Tech Explorer | Web Dev Whiz | AI Enthusiast`**

Hey there! I‚Äôm a Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for turning ideas into interactive digital experiences. Whether I‚Äôm building dynamic web platforms or experimenting with AI models for real-world use cases, I‚Äôm always exploring the edge of what‚Äôs possible with code.

When I‚Äôm not debugging or deploying, I‚Äôm diving into tech trends, participating in hackathons, and working on meaningful projects like AI-driven cheating surveillance systems, YOLO-powered trainer comparison apps, and sustainable agriculture tools.

### üå± My Journey So Far

- **Created an AI-driven proctoring app**:  
  Developed a sophisticated **AI-powered proctoring application** that captures and analyzes misalignment behavior in recorded videos. This system uses **computer vision** to monitor student focus during online exams and flags suspicious activity, such as eye and head misalignments, to ensure a fair testing environment.

- **Developed an AI-powered system for underwater debris detection**:  
  Built a real-time **AI system** that identifies and classifies **underwater debris** using advanced **computer vision techniques** like **YOLOv8**. This project aimed to tackle environmental challenges by detecting and tracking marine litter, ultimately contributing to sustainable ocean cleanup efforts. The system works in low-visibility underwater conditions, supporting conservation and waste management initiatives.

- **Developed ShopEase**:  
  Created **ShopEase**, a **comprehensive e-commerce application** leveraging the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with **Stripe** for secure payment processing. The app features **user authentication**, **product browsing**, **shopping cart functionality**, and **secure checkout**, with a **dynamic discount system** for promotional offers. It also includes an **admin dashboard** for managing products, orders, and customer data, providing a seamless shopping experience.

- **Built Konvo ‚Äì Real-Time Chat Application**:  
  Developed **Konvo**, a **real-time chat application** using the **MERN stack** and **Socket.io**. The platform supports real-time messaging, typing indicators, and notifications, ensuring users can communicate instantly. The system includes features like **group chats**, **JWT-based authentication** for secure logins, and a **responsive UI** for a smooth experience across devices, offering a simple yet powerful chat solution.

- **Visualized India‚Äôs City GDP**:  
  Visualized **India‚Äôs City GDP** using **Power BI** and **Streamlit** during my internship at **Infosys Springboard**. I created interactive dashboards that presented city-wise economic data in a user-friendly manner, providing insights for stakeholders to understand regional economic trends. This project helped refine my skills in data analysis, visualization, and real-time web application development.
